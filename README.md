# Homomorphic Estimation
Estimation of the variable map of noise out of SENSE magnetic resonance data using a homomorphic approach.

##Euler Math Toolbox
Euler Math Toolbox (EMT) is a powerful math program combining numerical and symbolic tools in one free package. It has been developed and is maintained by R. Grothmann, professor of mathematics at the University of Eichst√§tt, together with a net community of helping hands.
###Download
EMT can be downloaded from [project website](http://www.euler-math-toolbox.de/download.html).
###Installation
The installation process on Windows is straighforward and its detailed description can be found [here](http://www.euler-math-toolbox.de/documentation/installation.html). EMT can be also run on Linux under [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/).
##Running the application
Before the first run, fill in the configuration section in `main.e`:
```java
emFilterType = 2;  // 1 - local mean
                   // 2 - expectation-maximisation (EM)
emWindowSize = 3;  // window size for E{x}
emIterations = 10; // number of iterations of the EM algorithm
LPF = 3.4;         // sigma for LPF filter
lpfFSNR = 1.2;     // sigma for LPF filter; used to smooth sigma(x) in SNR
lpfFRice = 5.4;    // sigma for LPF filter; used to smooth Rician corrected noise map
inMR = "MR_noisy.csv";               // Noisy MR image
inSNR = "MR_SNR.csv";                // SNR
outGaussian = "MR_Gaussian_Map.csv"; // Estimated noise for Gaussian case
outRician = "MR_Rician_Map.csv";     // Estimated noise for Rician case
```
Then, open `notebook.en` and type `load main`.
